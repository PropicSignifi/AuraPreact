This is a demo for customizing table columns in either js file or json file.

The example registers the customization in '/System/UI/Table/Touchpoint_activeTouchpointsTable/columns'.

The json file is a little different from the js file, which further demonstrates how to manipulate fields fetching
in table managers.
